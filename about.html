                          Wizard Computing was created as a result  of a comment made by a friendâ€™s 
                          daughter. It started when I would help her with her computer, it would 
                          occasionally act up and I would come over to see what I could do, she would 
                          always exclaim "Bob, whenever you come near this silly computer, it starts 
                          behaving, whatever you do is magic. You're a Wizard." What was funny, was 
                          that I had just started a programming sub-contracting company, and was trying
                          to come up with a name, and that's how the company Wizard Computing began.

                          Now here we are in these current times with so many challenging items infront us to choose    
                          choose from. Large faceless companies that offer to build sites for you, companies that let
                          you build your own sites or even still others that just give you out-of-the-box, cookie-cutter, look-alike
                          sites that are just impersonal and really are not customized to the real needs or personality of your
                          business.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          That's where we differentiate ourselevs from the others. We believe in partnering with our customer,
                          being a quality added part of their process. Bringing a product to them is both unique and fits their 
                          needs and goals, that reflects their values, just as much as it does ours. And that this partnership will continue well into the 
                          future.
